# Ada: Division by Zero Example
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: division by zero. The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to perform a division operation where the divisor can be zero. The `bugSolution.ada` provides a solution to handle potential division-by-zero errors using exception handling.  The solution gracefully handles the exception and avoids program termination.

## How to Run
1.  Install an Ada compiler (e.g., GNAT).
2. Compile the code using your Ada compiler (e.g., `gnatmake bug.ada` and `gnatmake bugSolution.ada`).
3. Run the compiled executable.
